# Credit-EDA-Case-Study
Exploratory Data Analysis to identify loan defaulters

# Business Objective:
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as - denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

# Solution:
In this case study we use EDA to understand the influence of consumer and loan attributes on the tendency of default and identify such applicants in the process.
